dotnet publish -c Release
```

The published executable will be in `HotkeyLauncher/bin/Release/net10.0-windows/win-x64/publish/`.

### Building the Installer

To create the installer, you need [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) installed.

dotnet publish -c Release

# Then compile the installer (using Inno Setup CLI)
iscc installer/HotkeyLauncher.iss
```

The installer will be created in the `dist/` folder.

## Usage

### Target Examples

| Type | Example |

### Recommended Hotkeys

To avoid conflicts with existing shortcuts, consider using:
